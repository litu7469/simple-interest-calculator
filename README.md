# Simple Interest Calculator

## Description
A bash script to calculate simple interest for micro-finance applications. This tool helps calculate the interest amount based on principal, rate of interest, and time period.

## Formula
Simple Interest = (Principal × Rate × Time) / 100

Where:
- **Principal**: The initial amount of money
- **Rate**: The annual interest rate (in percentage)
- **Time**: The time period (in years)

## Prerequisites

3. Make the script executable:
```bash
